# Deepgram API Specs [Beta]

This is intended as the single-source-of-truth specification for the Deepgram API, being developed and maintained by the DX team. It includes the specifications of internal and external features.

## Status

These API specs are currently in beta release and expected to change frequently as we finalize our specfications for public consumption.

## Publishing Workflow

A public version of the specifications (scrubbed of internal and sensitive data) will be automatically published when any changes are made to our API to this repo.

## Latest Public Version

Check out the [openapi.yml](openapi.yml) file for the latest public version of the REST API spec.

Check out the [asyncapi.yml](asyncapi.yml) file for the latest public version of the WebSocket spec.


## Development and Contributing

* Directly modifying these API spec files in not allowed. Any API spec change should be done in the upstream Internal API Spec repository.
* Direct contributions to our Internal API specs are reserved to Deepgram Employees only.
